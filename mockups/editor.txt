================================================
  This file describes the mockups in editor.ep
  
  Since mockup files cannot be 'diffed' easily,
    each time the mockup is updated, this file
    should explain what you see in each page   
    
  Entries should stick to a the example format.
================================================

ExampleEntry: An example of mockup page description

	This is the longer, indented explanation. The explanation can be
	arbitrarily long, divided into newline-spaced paragraphs.

	The title should be the title of the page (in this case, 'ExampleEntry').
	After the title, a very short description follows (in this case, 
	'An example of mockup page description').
   
GeneralView: A general overview of the editor

	The MenuBar has
		File - for import, create, save, save-as, exit operations
		Edit - for undo/redo,
			and with nested submenus to create new views
			(equivalent to choosing them in the left-side vertical panel)
		View - view navigation (prev/next; changes current view focus to
			current/prev view
		Window - contains all current windows by type / nesting. Allows
		    groups to be closed, allows widow-settings saving and resetting
		Help - jumps to project web-page, allows file-bug-report, shows
		    "about" dialog
		    
		undo/redo, prev/next, search controls
		    
	The Left-side Vertical Panel has
		Tabs for view-groups, and in each
			buttons for launching new instances of these views
			
	The main view-area contains view-panels. In this case, 
		a list panel with all actors
			displaying a filter (same logic as in general search, but using
			an implicit 'type:ActorNode'; a history of filters is available
			in the drop-down menu)
			and, for each actor, inside a ~ 50px x 200px box,
				a representative image, 
				his short-name (clicking opens a panel to edit the actor)
				a short summary, with links to places of major use
		an asset view with all assets
			for each asset type, a list of assets
		an actor view displaying a given actor
			its name (editable), 
			thumbnail (selectable) and description (editable)
			the conversations he participates in (as a list)
			the scenes he participates in (as a list)
			the resources he is assigned (as a map)
