   Maven Recipes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Build the eclipse projects:
	mvn eclipse:eclipse

* Format file headers
	mvn com.mycila.maven-license-plugin:maven-license-plugin:format

* Make a clean build of everything
	mvn clean install -Dandroid.sdk.path=<path-to-android-sdk>

	NOTE: "javac" must be accesible
	NOTE: builds windows exes and self-executable jars of desktop-engine
    and editor-core; also builds playn webapp and android-engine apk;
    takes around 2 minutes on a quad-core; or 40s with -T 3;
    most of the time (~30s and ~50s) is dedicated to building 
    engine-android and engine-playn versions

* Make a clean build of a single module
	mvn clean install -pl ead:engine-desktop

	NOTE: you can use -pl A,B,C to specify multiple modules; 
	for a single module, you can "cd" to that module's directory and not use -pl

* Find the dependencies for a given module
	mvn depencency:tree -pl ead:engine-desktop

* Mavenize a jar (only when not mavenized online; this example uses jbox2d)
	mvn install:install-file -Dfile=jbox2d-library-2.1.2.jar \
		-DgroupId=org.jbox2d -DartifactId=jbox2d-library -Dversion=2.1.2 \
		-Dpackaging=jar -DlocalRepositoryPath=etc/repository

	NOTE: you will not be able to use it until you commit & push your changes 
	online; *before* you do that, change 
		<url>http://eadventure.googlecode.com/hg/etc/repository/</url>
	in the main pom.xml to 
		<url>file://local-project-root/etc/repository</url>
	to make sure everything works; it is very easy to get install-file wrong.

* Force re-download of a single artifact
	delete the artifact from your .m2 local repository; it will be re-downloaded
	OR
	use the -U flag (refreshes all plugins)

* Launch cobertura (check unit-test coverage) on a module
	mvn -pl ead:engine-desktop cobertura:check

* Launch findbugs on a module
	mvn -pl ead:engine-desktop findbugs:findbugs findbugs:gui

* Launch pmd on a module
	mvn -pl ead:engine-desktop pmd:pmd pmd:cpd

	NOTE: results are generated in the corresponding target/pmd.xml and target/cpd.xml

* Build all project reports
	mvn site -Dandroid.sdk.path=<path-to-android-sdk>

	NOTE: this currently performs a *lot* of duplicate work, and
	does not even build subproject pages (it lumps everything together);
	takes around 10 minutes on a quad-core...
