# eAdventure: creating and running adventure games

The eAdventure platform is a **free and open source game framework** based on Java, 
with an emphasis on educational uses. eAdventure uses a declarative XML language to create 
educational adventure games, both in first and third person.

The platform consists of two tools: the **eAdventure Editor**, a easy-to-use visual tool
to create _eAdventure games_, and the **eAdventure Engine**, a game engine able to run those games. 

This GitHub project hosts the new version of eAdventure (2.0 version), which provides a completely new code base 
to provide support for many new features.
